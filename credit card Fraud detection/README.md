Data preprocessing and normalization

Handling class imbalance using undersampling

Training a classification model (Random Forest)

Evaluation using precision, recall, and F1-score

Dataset
Contains anonymized transaction data with features Time, Amount, V1â€“V28, and target Class (0 = genuine, 1 = fraud).

Tools Used
Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, imbalanced-learn

Objective
